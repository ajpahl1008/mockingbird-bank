# Single command from a fresh clone to a running app: starts (or reuses) the
# local Postgres from docker-compose.yml, waits for it to be healthy, then
# runs the app against it in the foreground.
#
# Unlike scripts/run-interactive-qa.sh, this Postgres is *not* torn down on
# exit - it's the same named volume across runs (see docker-compose.yml), so
# your data survives between `dev-up.sh` sessions. Stop it explicitly with
# `docker compose down` (add `-v` to also wipe the data) when you're done for
# good.
